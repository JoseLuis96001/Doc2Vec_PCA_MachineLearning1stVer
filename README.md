# Doc2Vec_PCA_MachineLearning1stVer
This repository analyzes the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction algorithm and its effectiveness with various Machine Learning models. It uses a dataset with labeled data about true and false news taken from the IEEE Dateport (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/covid-19-fake-news-infodemic-research-dataset-covid19-fnir-dataset). Then, the Doc2Vec algorithm is applied to obtain the features. Then we compare the performance of the datasets without dimensionality reduction and with dimensionality reduction in several well-known Machine Learning modes. Finally, the K-fold cross validation algorithm is applied to obtain metrics that effectively indicate the accuracy of the models.
